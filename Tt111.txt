            "title": "A few quirks can be detracting, but still a 5-bubble stay, esp. if you have elite status or can score a larger room",
            "content": "My wife and I booked the Duxton for a 1-night staycation.  (Note #1 to Bonvoy members:  The basic room (\"Shophouse\") was going for 44k points and the Duxton Duplex was going for 65.8k points.  I booked the Shophouse, regularly priced at USD $286 for my night, with a 35k FNA and 9k extra points.)<br /><br />A couple nights before my stay, due to my elite status (Titanium), I was upgraded automatically to the Duxton Duplex King room, which included club lounge access: a USD $410 room.  So far so good.<br /><br />To get to this hotel, my wife and I took the MRT to Maxwell Station.  Then you basically just take Exit #3 and you'll see Duxton Road right across the street.  Total walking time from Maxwell Station to the hotel is about 2 minutes.<br /><br />We arrived at around 11:15am and were told that our room wasn't ready.  No problem.  We were traveling very light, and decided to get lunch.  When our room was ready, around 12:30pm, they sent me a whatsapp message.  Check-in was easy.  (This hotel is an Autograph hotel but has been under the Bonvoy name for a few years now, so operations has worked out the kinks.)<br /><br />(Note #2 to Bonvoy members: If you're Platinum, Titanium, or Ambassador, you'll get breakfast for free, for you and +1.  Then you can also choose between 1000 points or 2 cocktails per night.  We took the 2 cocktails.  Finally, you also get club lounge access for free.)<br /><br />This hotel has 49 rooms of varying size and layout.  It's an elegantly dark hotel.  But I think the first small surprise that hits you, when you first arrive, is that the whole hotel is a tiny bit musty.  Some blogs mentioned that the elevator is musty, but I found the whole hotel to be a bit musty, including my room.  After 5-10 minutes, when your nose gets used to it, it's not really as noticeable anymore.  (Another surprise that you might encounter, is that there are chickens sometimes hanging out in front of the main door.  The staff said that they are there to eat insects, and are assigned there by the government.  Not sure whether I misinterpreted that explanation from them, haha.)<br /><br />The elevator is slow, but the hotel has a sign inside that it cannot be renovated because the hotel is a historical site.  (The sign also said that JFK Jr and Darryl Hannah used this exact elevator when they were dating and visited Singapore.)  Anyways, the hotel is only 3 floors, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The layout of the Duxton Duplex can be found online on the Marriott website.  I think the only thing left a bit vague is the bathroom situation.  There's another review here on Tripadvisor remarking that the shower is not well-partitioned from the rest of the bathroom.  True.  Make sure to put the bathroom mat in front of the sink, to reduce the sloppiness of the water during the shower.  While the bathroom has a door, the WC inside does not.  Basically, when somebody is using the WC, it is pretty awkward if somebody wants to open the bathroom door to come in to brush their teeth or use the shower.  You've been warned.  :-)<br /><br />(Also take note that, obviously, if you have mobility problems, you'll probably not want the Duxton Duplex.  Those stairs can be a bit tough/hazardous to navigate for perfectly able-bodied people already (esp. at night: the stairs are painted a 'midnight black' color), much less to say those who are elderly or have bad balance.)<br /><br />The club lounge is actually a lounge bar called Anoushka's, actually open to the public.  So, in that sense, it's not really a club lounge.  If you are plat or above, or your booking includes club lounge access, basically that means that you get some free stuff during every day of your stay.  From 11-3pm, you get 3 \"small bites\", and from 5-8pm, you get another 3 \"small bites\" + 3 drinks.  Your +1 gets the same freebies.  The free drink options include coffees, soft drinks, negroni, and hard liquors.  To me, that package, considering the quality of the food and the ambiance, is reasonably rated at USD $100 per person if you went for the liquors.  If there are two of you staying in the room, that's a USD $200 value per night. (!)  (Of course, these are a la carte prices, compared to, say, a lounge buffet with alcohol, so you can do your own math, hehe.)<br /><br />This hotel has no gym or pool, but as the front desk explains it to you, you'll have access to the gym and pool at the Maxwell about 1-2 blocks away.<br /><br />Let's talk about breakfast the next morning.  There's no buffet here.  You'll get 2 selections from the menu, plus a juice and a coffee of your choice.  I'll keep it real for you:  it's not a lot of food.  We went down at around 9am, and there were only a few others eating around us.  I ended up getting a crab omelette and a fruit plate; and then orange juice and coffee.  My wife got basically the same, except two pieces of sourdough bread instead of the omelette.  We're OK with eating light during our travels, so it wasn't so bad.  But if you're looking to pig out on a breakfast buffet, this hotel will disappoint you.<br /><br />The hotel is in a very good location though, also for staycationers.  Just a block away from Koreatown, and a block in a slightly different direction from Chinatown and Maxwell Hawker Center.  We had a good time having a light afternoon meal and coffee at The Populus, and then a lunch the following day at Xiao Ya Tou (a tad bit pricey, but good flavors and just around the corner from the hotel: best to visit in a group of 3-4).<br /><br />The staff is not super-smiley, but they are polite and seem kind-hearted.  The doormen are all too willing to help you with the door and fetch an umbrella for you when it's raining.  Trust me, super-smiley doesn't really work at this hotel, with its dark elegant kind of vibe.  If you're an introvert and are super-sensitive to fake smiles and sickly-sweet demeanor, you'll appreciate this hotel even more.<br /><br />This hotel doesn't score so well on the Bonvoy website (only around a 3.7/5.0).  It scores better on Tripadvisor (a 4.5/5.0).  I feel that this hotel is best, the more that you are OK/looking for the following:  (i) You have visited Singapore before, but you are looking for something outside of Orchard Road; (ii) you want easy access to the MRT and good food (esp. Korean food); (iii) you don't really need a pool/gym in your building; (iv) you're tired of fighting the crowds on your vacations/staycations; (v) you are looking for helpful but not so smiley staff; and (vi) if you're platinum or above in the Bonvoy program.",

I reserved this room under a special promotion rate through the Marriott Bonvoy app … but the hotel declined to honor the promotion. Spent a lot of time on the phone with Marriott service and emailing documentation to the hotel.<br /><br />The shower in my room was also very poorly designed- glass divider was too short so water got all over the place. Also the bellmen seem to only work part-time. The front desk staff ended up having to help us with our bags .. and we were left yo carry the bags ourselves down the front steps of the hotel during check-out.<br /><br />I’ve never experienced anything like this at a “5 Star”. Hotel. Very disappointing experience - steer clear if you can.",

The service was top-notch, and they truly paid attention to every little detail.<br /><br />The hotel is on a beautiful historical site, which gives it so much character. The blend of history and modern comfort creates such a unique vibe, and the ambiance is amazing—peaceful, elegant, and relaxing. Because it’s a historic building, the rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but honestly, it just adds to the charm and coziness.<br /><br />Everything was super clean, from the rooms to the common areas. You can tell they really care about keeping the place spotless, which made my stay even more comfortable.<br /><br />The location is absolutely perfect. It’s super close to Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and surrounded by so many fun attractions, bars, and restaurants. It’s a great area to explore and enjoy everything the city has to offer.<br /><br />On top of all that, the whole area felt very safe, so I never had to worry, even when I was out late.<br /><br />Overall, this hotel has amazing service, great vibes, and the perfect location. I loved my stay and would definitely come back!",

            "title": "A few quirks can be detracting, but still a 5-bubble stay, esp. if you have elite status or can score a larger room",
            "content": "My wife and I booked the Duxton for a 1-night staycation.  (Note #1 to Bonvoy members:  The basic room (\"Shophouse\") was going for 44k points and the Duxton Duplex was going for 65.8k points.  I booked the Shophouse, regularly priced at USD $286 for my night, with a 35k FNA and 9k extra points.)<br /><br />A couple nights before my stay, due to my elite status (Titanium), I was upgraded automatically to the Duxton Duplex King room, which included club lounge access: a USD $410 room.  So far so good.<br /><br />To get to this hotel, my wife and I took the MRT to Maxwell Station.  Then you basically just take Exit #3 and you'll see Duxton Road right across the street.  Total walking time from Maxwell Station to the hotel is about 2 minutes.<br /><br />We arrived at around 11:15am and were told that our room wasn't ready.  No problem.  We were traveling very light, and decided to get lunch.  When our room was ready, around 12:30pm, they sent me a whatsapp message.  Check-in was easy.  (This hotel is an Autograph hotel but has been under the Bonvoy name for a few years now, so operations has worked out the kinks.)<br /><br />(Note #2 to Bonvoy members: If you're Platinum, Titanium, or Ambassador, you'll get breakfast for free, for you and +1.  Then you can also choose between 1000 points or 2 cocktails per night.  We took the 2 cocktails.  Finally, you also get club lounge access for free.)<br /><br />This hotel has 49 rooms of varying size and layout.  It's an elegantly dark hotel.  But I think the first small surprise that hits you, when you first arrive, is that the whole hotel is a tiny bit musty.  Some blogs mentioned that the elevator is musty, but I found the whole hotel to be a bit musty, including my room.  After 5-10 minutes, when your nose gets used to it, it's not really as noticeable anymore.  (Another surprise that you might encounter, is that there are chickens sometimes hanging out in front of the main door.  The staff said that they are there to eat insects, and are assigned there by the government.  Not sure whether I misinterpreted that explanation from them, haha.)<br /><br />The elevator is slow, but the hotel has a sign inside that it cannot be renovated because the hotel is a historical site.  (The sign also said that JFK Jr and Darryl Hannah used this exact elevator when they were dating and visited Singapore.)  Anyways, the hotel is only 3 floors, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The layout of the Duxton Duplex can be found online on the Marriott website.  I think the only thing left a bit vague is the bathroom situation.  There's another review here on Tripadvisor remarking that the shower is not well-partitioned from the rest of the bathroom.  True.  Make sure to put the bathroom mat in front of the sink, to reduce the sloppiness of the water during the shower.  While the bathroom has a door, the WC inside does not.  Basically, when somebody is using the WC, it is pretty awkward if somebody wants to open the bathroom door to come in to brush their teeth or use the shower.  You've been warned.  :-)<br /><br />(Also take note that, obviously, if you have mobility problems, you'll probably not want the Duxton Duplex.  Those stairs can be a bit tough/hazardous to navigate for perfectly able-bodied people already (esp. at night: the stairs are painted a 'midnight black' color), much less to say those who are elderly or have bad balance.)<br /><br />The club lounge is actually a lounge bar called Anoushka's, actually open to the public.  So, in that sense, it's not really a club lounge.  If you are plat or above, or your booking includes club lounge access, basically that means that you get some free stuff during every day of your stay.  From 11-3pm, you get 3 \"small bites\", and from 5-8pm, you get another 3 \"small bites\" + 3 drinks.  Your +1 gets the same freebies.  The free drink options include coffees, soft drinks, negroni, and hard liquors.  To me, that package, considering the quality of the food and the ambiance, is reasonably rated at USD $100 per person if you went for the liquors.  If there are two of you staying in the room, that's a USD $200 value per night. (!)  (Of course, these are a la carte prices, compared to, say, a lounge buffet with alcohol, so you can do your own math, hehe.)<br /><br />This hotel has no gym or pool, but as the front desk explains it to you, you'll have access to the gym and pool at the Maxwell about 1-2 blocks away.<br /><br />Let's talk about breakfast the next morning.  There's no buffet here.  You'll get 2 selections from the menu, plus a juice and a coffee of your choice.  I'll keep it real for you:  it's not a lot of food.  We went down at around 9am, and there were only a few others eating around us.  I ended up getting a crab omelette and a fruit plate; and then orange juice and coffee.  My wife got basically the same, except two pieces of sourdough bread instead of the omelette.  We're OK with eating light during our travels, so it wasn't so bad.  But if you're looking to pig out on a breakfast buffet, this hotel will disappoint you.<br /><br />The hotel is in a very good location though, also for staycationers.  Just a block away from Koreatown, and a block in a slightly different direction from Chinatown and Maxwell Hawker Center.  We had a good time having a light afternoon meal and coffee at The Populus, and then a lunch the following day at Xiao Ya Tou (a tad bit pricey, but good flavors and just around the corner from the hotel: best to visit in a group of 3-4).<br /><br />The staff is not super-smiley, but they are polite and seem kind-hearted.  The doormen are all too willing to help you with the door and fetch an umbrella for you when it's raining.  Trust me, super-smiley doesn't really work at this hotel, with its dark elegant kind of vibe.  If you're an introvert and are super-sensitive to fake smiles and sickly-sweet demeanor, you'll appreciate this hotel even more.<br /><br />This hotel doesn't score so well on the Bonvoy website (only around a 3.7/5.0).  It scores better on Tripadvisor (a 4.5/5.0).  I feel that this hotel is best, the more that you are OK/looking for the following:  (i) You have visited Singapore before, but you are looking for something outside of Orchard Road; (ii) you want easy access to the MRT and good food (esp. Korean food); (iii) you don't really need a pool/gym in your building; (iv) you're tired of fighting the crowds on your vacations/staycations; (v) you are looking for helpful but not so smiley staff; and (vi) if you're platinum or above in the Bonvoy program.",

I reserved this room under a special promotion rate through the Marriott Bonvoy app … but the hotel declined to honor the promotion. Spent a lot of time on the phone with Marriott service and emailing documentation to the hotel.<br /><br />The shower in my room was also very poorly designed- glass divider was too short so water got all over the place. Also the bellmen seem to only work part-time. The front desk staff ended up having to help us with our bags .. and we were left yo carry the bags ourselves down the front steps of the hotel during check-out.<br /><br />I’ve never experienced anything like this at a “5 Star”.

The service was top-notch, and they truly paid attention to every little detail.<br /><br />The hotel is on a beautiful historical site, which gives it so much character. The blend of history and modern comfort creates such a unique vibe, and the ambiance is amazing—peaceful, elegant, and relaxing. Because it’s a historic building, the rooms are a bit on the smaller side, but honestly, it just adds to the charm and coziness.<br /><br />Everything was super clean, from the rooms to the common areas. You can tell they really care about keeping the place spotless, which made my stay even more comfortable.<br /><br />The location is absolutely perfect. It’s super close to Marina Bay Sands (MBS) and surrounded by so many fun attractions, bars, and restaurants. It’s a great area to explore and enjoy everything the city has to offer.<br /><br />On top of all that, the whole area felt very safe, so I never had to worry, even when I was out late.<br /><br />Overall, this hotel has amazing service, great vibes, and the perfect location. I loved my stay and would definitely come back!",

            "content": "My wife and I recently had the displeasure of visiting The Projector and left utterly disappointed with the overall experience. The main reason for our discontent was our misunderstanding that the movie had Chinese subtitles as posted online.<br /><br />After a quick Google search, we were happy to find that they were supposedly offering Chinese subtitles for the newly released film, Wonka. I support the venue as a member so The Projector has been our default cinema since 2015 for any and every film. Since my wife’s English is a work in progress, we can only watch films with Chinese subtitles so this prospective feature played a significant role in our decision to choose this venue. However, our enthusiasm quickly turned into frustration when after the film started, we realized it was not subtitled in Chinese but oddly enough in English.<br /><br />I immediately went to the ticket counter and showed them the internet posting which is attached here. Unfortunately, the staff was absolutely indifferent to my concerns, offering no solution other than explaining that internet postings are often wrong and the onus was completely on me to confirm it prior to purchase. Ok. I got it. However, the tickets and movie were completely useless to us. <br /><br />When I asked about a credit or vouchers for another film, I was met with a dismissive attitude. The absence of any effort to rectify the situation was testimony to a generally poor level of customer service and general business acumen. On average, we spend $30-$40 on concessionary items alone per visit so it’s even difficult to justify them making an unemotional business decision. It felt more like spite.<br /><br />A moviegoing experience is not just about the film itself but also the overall service and effort made by the theater to provide their customers with a certain level of satisfaction. The Projector failed on both fronts, displaying a blatant disregard for customer satisfaction. We will probably still have to go there to see the small, independent films we enjoy but you may want to save yourself the potential frustration of dealing with the ticket staff there and consider other, more commercially oriented cinemas for your movie night, especially for major studio releases.<br />",

We were a little unsure about Hell's Museum as we thought it might be too religious/spiritual for us. However, it was the best thing we did in Singapore.  The tour explained different religions' views on death and the afterlife and the visit to the models of the Ten Courts of Hell was absolutely fascinating.  Entrance to the museum gives you 10% discount in the cafe.  It's probably a \"Marmite\" attraction but we loved it.",

Traditional Singapore Slings, for the girls and a Tiger beer for our son and myself. It’s pricey of course, but it’s worth it to take in the character of such an iconic place like the Long Bar with all irs history.

While we are frequent visitors to Bonvoy properties, the staff here are true masters of hospitality and made us feel so welcomed.<br /><br />The hotel is excellently located near many of the tourist sites and all the rest are reached easily from the metro station located below the hotel.  Along with the metro there are restaurants and several connected malls which can help you stay dry if it rains.<br /><br />Our room was very clean and well kept.  It’s very easy to get a good night’s sleep as the bed was really comfortable.<br /><br />When the weather’s right, head up to the 18th floor where the pool and casual bar/restaurant are located for impressive views of the city.  They also have pool and foosball tables that you can use.<br /><br />We had access to the executive lounge on the 2nd floor.  While it gets a lot of use, it’s a very nice amenity to have with breakfast, snacks and dinner options available along with evening cocktails.  What set the lounge apart for me was once again the staff.  Once again they were so welcoming, friendly and service oriented.<br /><br />I truly want to return to the JW Marriott South Beach on my next trip to Singapore.  I don’t think you’ll be disappointed either if you give it a try.",

On our last day in Singapore, my family and I had the pleasure of visiting Marina Bay, where we met a truly exceptional young lady Elena in the lobby. From the moment she approached us, we were struck by her warmth and kindness. She noticed we had luggage and, without hesitation, asked if we needed any assistance. We explained that we were just resting before heading to the airport, and Elena not only listened to us attentively but also engaged in a lovely conversation about the hotel and our first experience in Singapore. She was incredibly knowledgeable and made us feel truly welcome.<br /><br />Her thoughtfulness didn’t stop there—she gave us a beautiful silver magnet as a souvenir, which was such a kind and generous gesture that we’ll always remember.<br /><br />Elena’s professionalism, kindness, and genuine care for guests are exactly the qualities that make a stay memorable. She is a real asset to the hotel, and I sincerely hope she receives the recognition she deserves.<br /><br />I would absolutely love to return to Singapore and stay at this hotel, especially if this is the standard of service that’s offered to all guests.<br /><br />The shopping and rooftop bars at Marina Bay were also outstanding, providing endless options for an unforgettable experience!<br /><br />If you’re visiting Singapore, this is a must-visit destination.",

We only went into the cloud forest done which was the cheapest of the 3. It recreates cloud rainforest and is quite damp and misty but very interesting. They have a fantastic variety of orchids which are all very beautiful and very varied. The vegetation is very lush and prolific just as in the park itself. <br />  There are numerous toilets, all excellent, and numerous eating places. <br />  In the evening there is a free light show at 7:45 and 8:45 but, unfortunately we were unable to see it. I would highly recommend the gardens-a “must see” in my opinion.",

On our last day in Singapore, my family and I had the pleasure of visiting Marina Bay, where we met a truly exceptional young lady Elena in the lobby. From the moment she approached us, we were struck by her warmth and kindness. She noticed we had luggage and, without hesitation, asked if we needed any assistance. We explained that we were just resting before heading to the airport, and Elena not only listened to us attentively but also engaged in a lovely conversation about the hotel and our first experience in Singapore. She was incredibly knowledgeable and made us feel truly welcome.<br /><br />Her thoughtfulness didn’t stop there—she gave us a beautiful silver magnet as a souvenir, which was such a kind and generous gesture that we’ll always remember.<br /><br />Elena’s professionalism, kindness, and genuine care for guests are exactly the qualities that make a stay memorable. She is a real asset to the hotel, and I sincerely hope she receives the recognition she deserves.<br /><br />I would absolutely love to return to Singapore and stay at this hotel, especially if this is the standard of service that’s offered to all guests.<br /><br />The shopping and rooftop bars at Marina Bay were also outstanding, providing endless options for an unforgettable experience!<br /><br />If you’re visiting Singapore, this is a must-visit destination.",

They have priority lounges at every terminal including at the Jewel.<br /><br />The Jewel is located by Terminal 1 , a must stop for the water fall, shopping, food and souvenirs. They have a luggage locker with a fee at the jewel as well. <br /><br />The Changi Lounge at the Jewel is ok, given the location it is at it’s very crowded , people can pay to come in even without any priority status. It comes with limited foods and drinks offered, each customer is allowed to order one hot food from menu and one beer, all additional items will need to pay extra. This lounge does have showers to use for free.<br /><br />Walk to other terminals from the Jewel is short, and easy to navigate.",

I also loved the indoor garden vibes, making it a relaxing escape even in a bustling space.<br /><br />Jewel isn’t just an airport—it’s a destination on its own. Whether you’re shopping, dining, or just taking in the beautiful sights, there’s something for everyone. I could easily spend hours here. Definitely a must-visit if you’re flying through Singapore!",

After around 20 minutes walking you come to small beach with bbq facilities and toilets /shower facilities. Depending how long you have, you can walk for hours actually arriving in Singapore Centre simply follow the well informed pathway and be impressed by the facilities and amenities including restaurants as you meander your way through the park.",

That the entire place bar the Orchid Garden is free is amazing, and makes it all the more attractive as a must-see place in Singapore.
